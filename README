This is the code base for libbot2.

The libbot2 project provides a set of libraries, tools, and algorithms that are
designed to facilitate robotics research. Among others, these include
convenience functions for maintaining coordinate transformations, tools for
parameter management and process administration, and a 3D visualization
library. Initially developed at MIT for the 2007 DARPA Grand Challenge, libbot2
is designed to provide a core set of capabilities for robotics applications and
has been utilized on a number of different robotic vehicles.

The libbot2 library follows the PODs build architecture guidelines
(http://sourceforge.net/p/pods/home/Home/).

Overview
========

libbot2 is a collection of several pieces of software (PODs). Some PODs may
depend on others. The current list of PODs is:

  bot2-core       C library with some simple but useful routines and a set of
                  core message types (LCM types).

  bot2-vis        C library of classes and functions for visualizing data with
                  OpenGL and GTK2.

  bot2-lcmgl      Transmitting and rendering OpenGL commands over LCM.

  bot2-procman    Process management tools for controlling many processes on
                  one or many workstations.

  bot2-lcm-utils  LCM utility programs (tunnel LCM over TCP, chop or splice log
                  files, etc.)

Requirements
============

  These are required:

    GLib 2.0+
    CMake 3.3+
    LCM         (https://lcm-proj.github.io/)
    Java        (Sun JDK or OpenJDK strongly preferred)
    Python
    GTK+ 2.0+   (required by bot2-vis)
    OpenGL      (required by bot2-vis)
    GLUT
    PyGTK

  Note that some PODs may have fewer requirements (e.g., if you just want
  bot2-core).

  Run one of the following scripts to install these requirements to your
  system:

    MacOS or OS X using Homebrew   scripts/setup/mac/install_prereqs
    Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty"          scripts/setup/linux/ubuntu/trusty/install_prereqs
    Ubuntu 16.04 "Xenial"          scripts/setup/linux/ubuntu/xenial/install_prereqs

  Additionally, you'll need to install LCM from https://lcm-proj.github.io/.

(Local) Installation
====================

  libbot2 adheres to the PODs core policy and makes use of the PODs build
  tools. For more information about PODs, see https://sourceforge.net/p/pods/.

  You can install libbot2 to your system by running:

  $ sudo make BUILD_PREFIX=/usr/local

  If you don't want to install libbot2 to your system, you can also build it
  inside the source directory. To do this, run:

  $ make

  In this case, the executables, headers, libraries, etc. will be installed
  according to the PODs core policy. If no other "build" directory is found, it
  will default to libbot2/build/.

Uninstallation
==============

  If compiled and installed to your system, run:

  $ sudo make clean

  Note that this can only be done from the libbot2 source that was used for
  installation.

Documentation
=============

  To build documentation, install Doxygen and then run:

  $ cd doc
  $ doxygen

  HTML docs will then be build to doc/html/.
